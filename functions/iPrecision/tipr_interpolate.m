%
% Interpolates between two points in temporal integrated P-R space 
% according to temporal skew characteristics defined by the anonymous 
% function pi_function within the time interval [0 T] starting at skew pi_1.
% 
% The skew_function should be an anonymous function that takes time, t, as 
% an argument and contain the initial skew, pi_1, for example
%   
%   pi_1        = 0.0001;
%   pi_function = @(t)(floor_to_one(2.^t .* pi_1));
%
% do not forget that the output should be in the range [0 1].
