%
% Calculates a point on the weighted integrated Precision-Recall curve 
% according to the skews pi1 and pi2 and the weights defined by the 
% anonymous function w_function.
%
% The detection should be in the format of a N x 1 or 1 x N vector,
% where N is the number of instances. It should contain the value 
% class_labels(1) for a negative detection and class_labels(2) for a 
% positive detection. Therefore class_labels is a 1 x 2 vector containing
% the labels of the classes, i.e. [neg_label, pos_label].
%
% The gt should be in the format of a N x 1 or 1 x N vector, containing 
% the value class_labels(1) for the negative class and class_labels(2) 
% for the positive class.
%
% The w_function should be an anonymous function that takes skew, pi, as 
% an argument and returns its weight, for example
%   
%   w_function = @(pi')((1 / (pi_m * sqrt(2*pi)) * exp((pi' - pi_s)/pi_m)));
%
% where pi = 3.14..., pi_m is the mean of the skew range and pi_s its
% standard deviation. Do not forget that the output should be in the range [0 1].
