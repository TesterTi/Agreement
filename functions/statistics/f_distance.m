function dist = f_distance(d1, d)


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% DIST = F_DISTANCE(D1, D)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% This function take a vector d1 and a matrix d and calculates the f1 
% distance between the vector and each row of the matrix.
%
% See our paper for details regarding each of this process and 'help pdist'
% for more information regarding the form of the function. 
%
% Input:
%
%      d1 - a 1 x N 'sample' vector 
%           
%      d - a M x N 'target' matrix
%
% Output:
%
%      dist - a M x 1 vector representing the distances between d1 and each
%             row of the matrix d.
