%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Searches for the point of dataset skew in which the ranking of two 
% algorithms, measured as the AUCPR, inverts. To make things slightly more
% efficient the function assumes that the precisions, p_1h, p_2h, have
% already been transformed to the highest skew in the search range, i.e.
%
%    p_1h = p_skew_transform(p_1, pi, 1-epsilon);
%    p_2h = p_skew_transform(p_2, pi, 1-epsilon);
%
% where 1-epsilon is the upper bound on the search range and pi is the skew
% at which precision was calculated. For more information see the 
% auc_switch function.
%
% This function will only return one point at which the rank inverts, if 
% more exist within the skew range (0,1) the function 
% auc_rank_switch_linear_search should be used to perform an exhaustive 
% search. The maximum number of inversions that CAN occur is equal to the 
% number of times the P-R curves cross (although this is a maximum and the 
% number of inversions may be less).
