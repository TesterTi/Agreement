function p_s = auc_rank_switch_linear_search(response_1, response_2, gt, class_labels)


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Performs an exhaustive (linear) search for the points at which the rank
% of two algorithms responses response_1 and response_2, inverts with skew. 
% This function returns an empty list if a change isn't found, otherwise,
% a list of the skews at which the inversion occurrs is returned.
%
% The maximum number of inversions that CAN occur is equal to the number 
% of times the P-R curves cross (although this is a maximum and the number 
% of inversions may be less).
%
% Class_labels is a 1 x 2 vector containing the labels of the classes, 
% i.e. [neg_label pos_label].
% 
% N.B. the speed of this function would receive a big improvement if 
%      translated into C.
%

%   Unrepresentative Precision'. In Machine Learning 97 (1-2): 5â€”32, 2014.
