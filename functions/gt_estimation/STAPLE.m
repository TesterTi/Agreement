%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% This function takes a set of annotations and the ground truth according 
% to the STAPLE method.
%
% The STAPLE method is taken from:
%
%   B. Landman, J. Bogovic and J. Prince, 'Simultaneous truth and 
%        performance level estimation with incomplete, over-complete, and 
%        ancillary data', in: Proc. SPIE Medical Imaging 2010: Image 
%        Processing, vol. 7623, 2010.
% 
% Input:
%
%      annotations - a 3 dimensional matrix, n x m x p, where n and m are
%                    the image's size and p is the number of annotations. 
%                    Within which a one represents an object's location and 
%                    zero none.
%
% Output:
%
%      staple_gt - a n x m matrix representing the resulting ground truth. 
%                  Within which a one represents an object's location and 
%                  zero none.
