% Calculates a point on the Precision-Recall curve.
%
% The detection should be in the format of a N x 1 or 1 x N vector,
% where N is the number of instances. It should contain the value 
% class_labels(1) for a negative detection and class_labels(2) for a 
% positive detection. Therefore class_labels is a 1 x 2 vector containing
% the labels of the classes, i.e. [neg_label, pos_label].
%
% The gt should be in the format of a N x 1 or 1 x N vector, containing 
% the value class_labels(1) for the negative class and class_labels(2) 
% for the positive class.
