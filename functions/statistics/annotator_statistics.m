% [SENS, SPEC, PPV, NPV, KAPPA] = ANNOTATOR_STATISTICS(ANNOTATIONS)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% This function takes a set of annotations and calculates the sensitivity, 
% specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and 
% kappa relative to 50% agreement between the annotators.
%
% See our paper for details regarding this process.
% 
% Input:
%
%      annotations - a 3 dimensional matrix, n x m x p, where n and m are
%                    the image's size and p is the number of annotations. 
%                    Within which a one represents an object's location and 
%                    zero none.
%
% Output:
%
%      sens - a 1 x p vector containing the sensitivity calculated for each
%             annotation.
%
%      spec - a 1 x p vector containing the specificty calculated for each
%             annotation.
%
%      PPV - a 1 x p vector containing the positive predictive value 
%            calculated for each annotation.
%
%      NPV - a 1 x p vector containing the negative predictive value 
%            calculated for each annotation.
%
%      kappa - a 1 x p vector containing the kappa value  calculated for 
%              each annotation.
