% Calculates a point on the tempral integrated Precision-Recall curve 
% according to temporal skew characteristics defined by the anonymous 
% function pi_function within the time interval [0 T] starting at skew pi_1.
%
% The detection should be in the format of a N x 1 or 1 x N vector,
% where N is the number of instances. It should contain the value 
% class_labels(1) for a negative detection and class_labels(2) for a 
% positive detection. Therefore class_labels is a 1 x 2 vector containing
% the labels of the classes, i.e. [neg_label, pos_label].
%
% The gt should be in the format of a N x 1 or 1 x N vector, containing 
% the value class_labels(1) for the negative class and class_labels(2) 
% for the positive class.
%
% The skew_function should be an anonymous function that takes time, t, as 
% an argument and contain the initial skew, pi_1, for example
%   
%   pi_1        = 0.0001;
%   pi_function = @(t)(floor_to_one(2.^t .* pi_1));
%
% do not forget that the output should be in the range [0 1].
