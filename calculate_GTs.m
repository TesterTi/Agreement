% [GTS, GT_LABELS] = CALCULATE_GTS(ANNOTATIONS)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% This function takes a set of annotations and calculates several ground
% truth estimations based upon them (LSML, Any position marked by an 
% annotator, 50% agreement between annotators, 75% agrement between 
% annotators, STAPLE, exclude outlier annotators, and exclude outlier 
% annotators and taking 50% agreement between the remaining). See our paper 
% for references to each of these methods.
% 
% Input:
%
%      annotations - a 3 dimensional matrix n x m x p, where n and m are
%                    the image's size and p is the number of annotations.
%                    Within which a one represents an object's location and 
%                    zero none.
%
% Output:
%
%      gts - a 3 dimensional matrix n x m x 7 matrix, in which the third
%            dimension represents different ground truths. Within which a 
%            one represents an object's location and zero none.
%
%      gt_labels - a 1 x 7 cell, which contains the names for the methods
%                  used to calculate each ground truth.
%
%      This function also creates a subdirectory called 'gts' in which it
%      saves images files of each ground truth.
