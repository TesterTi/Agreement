function pi_m = auc_rank_switch_test(response_1, response_2, gt, class_labels)


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Tests whether the rank of two algorithms, represented by their responses 
% response_1 and response_2, inverts with skew. This function returns -1 
% if no inversion occurs, otherwise the skew at which the inversion occurs 
% will be returned.
%
% This test will only work if an odd number of inversions occur within the 
% skew range (0,1), otherwise the function auc_rank_switch_linear_search
% should be used to perform an exhaustive search. The maximum number of 
% inversions that CAN occur is equal to the number of times the P-R curves
% cross (although this is a maximum and the number of inversions may be
% less).
%
% Class_labels is a 1 x 2 vector containing the labels of the classes, 
% i.e. [neg_label pos_label].

%   Unrepresentative Precision'. In Machine Learning 97 (1-2): 5â€”32, 2014.
