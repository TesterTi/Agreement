%
% Calculates the temporal integrated Precision-Recall curve according to 
% temporal skew characteristics defined by the anonymous function 
% pi_function within the time interval [0 T] starting at skew pi_1.
%
% The response should be in the format of a N x 1 or 1 x N vector,
% where N is the number of instances.
%
% The gt should be in the format of a N x 1 or 1 x N vector, the minimum 
% value is assumed to be the negative class and maximum the positive class.
%
% The skew_function should be an anonymous function that takes time, t, as 
% an argument and contain the initial skew, pi_1, for example
%   
%   pi_1        = 0.0001;
%   pi_function = @(t)(floor_to_one(2.^t .* pi_1));
%
% do not forget that the output should be in the range [0 1].
