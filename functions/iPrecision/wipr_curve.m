% Calculates the weighted integrated Precision-Recall curve according to 
% the weights defined by the anonymous function w_function.
%
% The response should be in the format of a N x 1 or 1 x N vector,
% where N is the number of instances.
%
% The gt should be in the format of a N x 1 or 1 x N vector, the minimum 
% value is assumed to be the negative class and maximum the positive class.
%
% The w_function should be an anonymous function that takes skew, pi, as 
% an argument and returns its weight, for example
%   
%   w_function = @(pi')((1 / (pi_m * sqrt(2*pi)) * exp((pi' - pi_s)/pi_m)));
%
% where pi = 3.14..., pi_m is the mean of the skew range and pi_s its
% standard deviation. Do not forget that the output should be in the range 
% [0 1].
