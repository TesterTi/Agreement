% RECREATE_FIGURES
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% This function recreates the figures from the fissure case study in the paper:
%
%	T. Lampert, A. Stumpf, and P. Gancarski, 'An Empirical Study into 
%       Annotator Agreement, Ground Truth Estimation, and Algorithm 
%       Evaluation', IEEE Transactions on Image Processing 25 (6): 
%       2557â€“2572, 2016.
%
% This is a good starting point to follow and understand the included
% functions. All of the outputs will be placed within a folder called
% 'output'. This will include:
%
%       - various figures in eps and matlab format.
%
%       - agreement_statistics.txt containing the statistics calculated
%         using the annotations. (See agreement_analysis.m for more
%         information.)
%
%       - detector_ranks.txt containing the performance of each detector 
%         calculated using the different ground truths, and finally the 
%         rankings observed when using different ground truths. (See
%         detector_analysis.m for more information.
%
%       - a folder called gts which will contain the ground truths
%         calculated according to the annotations.

% LOAD THE DATA

% Load the image

% its training mask for all detector to make the comparison fair). Comment
% out these two lines if you are using unsupervised methods.

% PERFORM THE ANALYSES
